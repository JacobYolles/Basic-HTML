# Basic-HTML

This is designed to show the basic layout for how a HTML document could/should be layed out and the way that elements within it are coded to allow for them to appear on a basic webpage. This should be able to be understood by both someone who codes, and someone who has never coded before. 

This covers primarily the elements within the <"body"> tag, including:
1. <"h1"> - <"h6"> how these headers are used and what they allow the text they surround to do, either making them bigger or smaller.
2. <"div"> division and how this tag seperates elements from the screen based on the code.
3. <"p"> the paragraph tag to enclose itself with the text inside to allow it show up in a paragraph format.
4. <"em"> and <"strong"> tags which surround text to allow for italics, and bold font respectively.
5. <"br"> Line break. Allowing the next content to be below the content seperated by the <"br">.
6. <"ul"> Unordered list. This allows the elements to be placed in a list that will seperate their items with bullet points. 
7. <"li"> List item(s) this is a sub element of the <"ul"> or <"ol"> tag and allow for their to be stacked items in the unordered or ordered lists.
8. <"ol"> Ordered list. The allows the elements to be placed in a list that will seperate their items by numbers, ex. 1. 2. 3.
9. <"img"> The image tag, and its corresponding elements contained within, like the src which contains the location of where the image is stored, and the alt which contains information about what the elements contain, should the page not load and for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
10. <"video"> However, this piece uses youtubes generated formula instead of the video tag.
