      <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
      <!-- In the paragraph below there is an example of one way to stylize text elements through HTML. In this example, <em> references emphasis or italics, so Ursus arctos will be italicized, while Least Concern has strong which will appear as bold.  -->
        <!-- Another formatting style is <br> which represents a line break. With it applied the sentence starting after Least Concern will begin two lines below Least Concern. -->
      <p>The brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America. Its conservation status is currently <strong>Least Concern</strong>.  <br> <br> There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.</p>
      <!-- Below species we begin to create a list, in this case, the <ul> stands for unordered list, there also could be <ol> which would stand for ordered list. Of note is that the <ul> and <ol> are not to contain raw text as it will not render the contents into a list format but rather as plain text. <li> here stands for list item and surrounds each item of this list to create each specific content piece. When rendered this will have bullet points in front of each list item. -->
      <h3>Species</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Arctos </li>
      <li> Collarus </li>
      <li> Horribilis </li>
      <li> Nelsoni (extinct) </li>
    </ul>
      <p>"Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from 5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe. " </p>

    <div id= "media">
      <!-- Below the Media tag is an instance of an image tag. The image tag is self enclosing meaning that it does not need to be formatted as <img> and </img> though that process can work as well. With a link to a photo of a brown bear from the internet, an image is rendered once the page is constructed.
      After the media source, and alt attribute can be used. The alt attribute, or alternate attribute allows for the website to display information on what the image is should the page fail to load the image. Also allows for the image to be filtered online through search engine optimization, since the web doesn't actually visually see the image, just the code.-->
